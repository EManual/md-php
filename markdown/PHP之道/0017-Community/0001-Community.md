# Community 
The PHP community is as diverse as it is large, and its members are ready and willing to support new PHP programmers.
Consider joining your local PHP user group (PUG) or attending larger PHP conferences to learn more about the best
practices shown here. You can hang out on IRC in the #phpc channel on [irc.freenode.com][php-irc] and follow the
[@phpc][phpc-twitter] twitter account. Get out there, meet new developers, learn new topics, and above all, make new
friends! Other community resources include the Google+ PHP [Programmer community][php-programmers-gplus] and
[StackOverflow][php-so].
