## PHP User Groups 
If you live in a larger city, odds are there's a PHP user group nearby. You can easily find your local PUG at
the [usergroup-list at php.net][php-uglist] which is based upon [PHP.ug][php-ug]. Alternate sources might be
[Meetup.com][meetup] or a search for ```php user group near me``` using your favourite search engine
(i.e. [Google][google]). If you live in a smaller town, there may not be a local PUG; if that's the case, start one!

Special mention should be made of two global user groups: [NomadPHP] and [PHPWomen]. [NomadPHP] offers twice monthly
online user group meetings with presentations by some of the top speakers in the PHP community.
[PHPWomen] is a non-exclusive user group originally targeted towards the women in the PHP world. Membership is open to
everyone who supports a more diverse community. PHPWomen provide a network for support, mentorship and education, and
generally promote the creating of a "female friendly" and professional atmosphere.
