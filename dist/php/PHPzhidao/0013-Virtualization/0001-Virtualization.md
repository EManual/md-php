# Virtualization 
Running your application on different environments in development and production can lead to strange bugs popping up
when you go live. It's also tricky to keep different development environments up to date with the same version for all
libraries used when working with a team of developers.

If you are developing on Windows and deploying to Linux (or anything non-Windows) or are developing in a team, you
should consider using a virtual machine. This sounds tricky, but besides the widely known virtualization environments
like VMware or VirtualBox, there are additional tools that may help you setting up a virtual environment in a few easy
steps.
